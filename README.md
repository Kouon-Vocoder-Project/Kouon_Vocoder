# Kouon_Vocoder
[中文文档(同步更新)](https://github.com/Kouon-Vocoder-Project/Kouon_Vocoder/blob/main/README-zh.md)

The kouon_vocoder project is a vocoder project driven by the SVS community and the producers involved in singing synthesis. It aims to solve the range problem of the OpenVPI NSF-HiFiGAN vocoder and the sound quality problem of the Fish NSF-HiFiGAN vocoder.

This project is part of the Multi-langs project and runs as a separate sub-project.

This Vocoder project is intended for research and non-commercial use only.
